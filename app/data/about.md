#### Intro

I am a supply chain management professional at [Chevron](https://www.chevron.com/) where I work on negotiating contracts with vendors because I am awesome and super good at it. 
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in procurement, supply chain management, and sustainability. I enjoy category management and serving as product owner for enterprise supply chain applications and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Houston but willing to travel to U.S based locations.
<br><br>

#### Currently

At Chevron, I have learned how to work across diverse teams across multiple levels of leadership, build relationships with customers, and lead digital solutions in the supply chain sector, and serve as the XYZ Global Network as Networking Champion.
<br><br>

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

#### Travel / Geography 

- I am from originally from Moldova (It's ok, I know you are going to Google Search it). I have since lived in
  Houston, Texas and about to move to San Fransisco, California! 

- I've been to ~ 10 countries, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.

- In 2018, I met this nerdy kid at work named Farzad who emailed me begging to attend this book talk through the XYZ network. 

- In 2019, I saw that nerdy kid at work named Farzad who wouldn't stop talking to me at my Amazon Business showcase.

- In 2019, I also saw that nerdy kid again winning all sort of events to particpate in XYZ networking events like more book talks, Houston Astros Games, and happy hours. We started to become friends. 

- In 2020, I wanted to get closer with him because I loved talking to him and his authenticity and genuine personality. It was really easy to talk to him and I enjoyed all the time I spent with him. I reached out to him to start my dream company homexpartners. Even though Farzad didn't entirely believe in the idea, he went out of his way to help my dream become a reality. I really admired that trait about him and his continued devotion to myself and homexpartners. Later, we came to the conclusion that the cost/benefit wasn't really worth our time. We then collaborated on another vision called Mindful Living. Again, Farzad out of the goodness of his heart put together wireframes to show us his capabilities and technical design of the product. We continue to maintain a very healthy relationship and I think about him so much anytime he isn't around me. His presence in my life gives me laughter, joy, happiness, inspiration, and charisma that affirms the person I know I am. He allows me to be myself and have utmost trust and respect for him and his actions. I am so glad to have a guy like Farzad in my life and I want him in my life forever.
